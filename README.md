## Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for checking my solution to [Loopstudios Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw) Frontend Mentor challenges. 
Feel free to take a look, use or share any piece of code if you want.

## Overview
In this challenge I used:
- HTML
- Sass
- A bit of JavaScript

## The Challenge
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Feedback 
Feedback is always welcome, if you any sugestion please let me know
This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

Have fun building! ðŸš€
